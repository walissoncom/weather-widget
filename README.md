## Set Up & Instructions

### Setting up environment
First, you need to have the proper environment set up in your machine to run react projects. You need Node.JS installed and React. If you do not have the required environment, please check the link bellow for instructions on how to install it:

<br />
<br />

### Getting the source code

Once you have the environment set up, you need to get the source code. Clone the source code from the following GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/walissoncom/weather-widget](https://github.com/walissoncom/weather-widget)
<br />

If you need help to clone a repository from GitHub, here is an article that will guide you through those steps:

<br />
<br />

### Code pre-set up – API Key

**IMPORTANT STEP**: Open the source code into your preferred code editor and add your Open Weather Map API Key to the ‘keys.js’ file.

To get the API Key, go to:  [https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
<br />

Once you have the API Key, past it into the ‘keys.js’ file. See below the file path:

Project files path: **src/services/keys.js**
<br />
<br />

### Install dependencies

If you are using the source code from the email attachment, you can ignore this step.

Open the terminal and run the following command and wait for it to end:

`npm install`

or

`npm i`
<br />
<br />

### Start application

Start the application by running the following command:

`npm start`
<br />
<br />

### Visit app
